# 2. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list using a for loop.
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# sum_of_numbers = 0

# for num in numbers:
#     sum_of_numbers += num

# print(f"The sum of numbers is: {sum_of_numbers}")

# 3. Write a Python program to find the factorial of a number using a for loop.

# factorial = 1

# for i in range(1, n+1):
#     factorial *= i

# print(f"The factorial of {n} is: {factorial}")

# 4. Write a Python program to print all the even numbers between 1 and 50 using a for loop.
